# 🔐 Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 📝 Objective
The goal of this task was to understand the characteristics of strong passwords and evaluate them using password strength testing tools.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com)
- [Security.org Password Strength Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

---

## ✅ What I Did
- Created passwords with increasing complexity.
- Evaluated each password using tools like PasswordMeter and Security.org's checker.
- Noted how different factors (length, symbols, numbers, case sensitivity) impact strength.
- Researched common password attacks (e.g., brute force, dictionary attacks).
- Documented best practices for creating secure passwords.

## 💡 Best Practices Learned

- Use at least **12 characters** in passwords.
- Include **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **special characters**.
